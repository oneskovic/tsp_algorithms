# TSP Algorithms
Solving the travelling salesman problem using different heuristic approaches. Visualized using SFML. 
## Preview
Solving TSP for n=50 using the genetic algorithm (slowed down to look nicer)

## Algorithms
Currently there are 3 different heuristic algorithms implemented for solving TSP:
1. Ant colony simulation
2. Simulated annealing
3. Genetic algorithm
